    <p>If you want to lose weight, a great way to do it is to start cycling at least 30 minutes a day. Both give you similar results to help you lose weight.Riding a bike can actually burn a lot of calories depending on the speed and intensity of the ride.Cycling is therefore a good option to lose weight. But that's not only because of the calories you burn, it also affects your basal metabolic rate and muscle mass. As you push down or pull up on the pedals you are meeting resistance so you will be building muscle.</p>
